# odin-recipes

This is a recipes website for a [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) project.

I've used the `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<a>` and `<img>` tags.

I didn't use the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags because I didn't find them necessary.

Fortunately, I didn't find much difficulty in this project. I would have added a cake recipe here to fill up space but given this is a recipes website this is also unecessary.
