  <p>Spaghetti aglio e olio is a traditional Italian pasta dish from Naples. It is a typical dish of Neapolitan cuisine
    and is widely popular. Its popularity can be attributed to it being simple to prepare and the fact that it makes use
    of inexpensive, readily available ingredients that have long shelf lives in a pantry.</p>
  <h2>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
    <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
    <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
    <p>Directions</p>
  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
      until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
    <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly
      toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until
      garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on
      Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.</li>
    <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
